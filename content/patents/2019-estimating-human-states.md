abstract = "A system (100) comprising a plurality of devices for sensing, detecting or measuring data associated with a person's experience over time, the system comprising a controller (1) having a timer, the controller configured to: repeatedly send queries, at times recorded by the controller's timer, to each of the plurality of devices, wherein each query requests a signal from the queried device that the device has started to sense, detect or measure data associated with the experience; record, for each of the plurality of devices, the time according to the timer at which the device sent the signal and signal value received from the queried device; and compile signal values received from the plurality of devices based on the recorded times at which signal values were received, to thereby synchronise data which has been sensed, detected or measured by the plurality of devices."
