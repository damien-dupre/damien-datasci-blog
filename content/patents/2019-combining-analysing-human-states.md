abstract = "A system comprising a plurality of devices for sensing, detecting or measuring physiological and expressive data streams associated with a person's experience over time, the system comprising a processor configured to synchronise the data streams to obtain synchronised data; select feature data from the synchronised data, the feature data being descriptive of at least one human state of the person; model the feature data using a locally weighted polynomial regression model; and process the modelled feature data using multivariate autoregressive state-space modelling in order to identify at least one potential trend in the experience over time."
